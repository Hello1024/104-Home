# 3D Printing things!!!

The 3d printer is for all to use.   It breaks a lot, but don't worry if it breaks because it's usually easy to fix.   Here's how to get started:

## Design a thing

### Easiest:
Pick a 3d thing from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).   Download it in 'stl' format.

### Hard:
Design a thing yourself.    I suggest using Blender (best for people, flowers, sofas, and other curvy things) or Fusion 360 (best for cubes, pipes, screws, and other geometric shapes).    When done, export it into STL format.

## Put it into the printer software ('slicer')
The 3d printer is easiest to use with "Cura" software. 

### Setup on your laptop
[Download it here](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/)

Once installed, create a local  "ultimaker 2+" and import [this settings file](3dprintsettings.curaprofile).


Go to the 'marketplace' and install the (free) "moonraker" plugin.

Go "settings, printer, manage printers, ultimaker 2+, connect moonraker.

Type "http://192.168.91.69/" into the top box.    On the "upload tab" choose the "with thumbnail" option.

### Use the printer

Click this link:  [http://192.168.91.69/](http://192.168.91.69/)  (must be on the eightlegs wifi)

If it won't load, remove the power USB to the little circuit board near the printer, plug it in again, and wait a few mins.

Turn on the printer.   Switch is awkwardly on the back, left hand side.

From there you can press "Restart Firmware" if needed to reset everything.

You can use the buttons to `UNLOAD_FILAMENT` and `LOAD_FILAMENT` under `Tools` to put the plastic in for whatever color you need.  Warm it up to 210C (extruder temperature) first.

When you're ready to go, click the print button in Cura and it should go (after a few mins of warming up).


If the machine screws up, you can turn it off with the power switch, or the emergency stop button at the above link.

If something breaks and you can't fix it, ask on the house group and someone will be around to ask.  It is fairly robust and anyway every part can be replaced for not much money, so don't worry about doing the wrong thing.
